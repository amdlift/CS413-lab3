@ Purpose: Simulates a single serve coffee machine like a Keurig.
@
@          The machine starts with a full 48 oz water reservoir.  The user
@          presses B to start a cup or T to turn the machine off, then picks
@          a cup size:
@
@              Small    6 oz
@              Medium   8 oz
@              Large   10 oz
@
@          If there is not enough water left for the size that was picked the
@          program says so and asks for a smaller size.  Otherwise it says it
@          is ready to brew, asks for a cup in the tray, and waits for B to be
@          pressed again before pouring.
@
@          After each cup the water is checked.  Once it drops below 6 oz the
@          machine cannot make even a small cup, so it prints a refill message
@          and shuts off.
@
@          Typing COFFEE at any prompt shows how much water is left and how
@          many cups of each size have been made.  It is not listed in any of
@          the menus, which is what makes it the hidden code.

@               accepts, so the caller falls through to its own error
